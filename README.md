# SmartDashboard-USBRotate
### a simple widget for the original SmartDashboard (not SFX) that allows you to rotate USB camera images.

This is basically the code for the USB Camera widget in the SmartDashboard but with code copied verbatim from the IP camera widget to rotate the image.

This functionality should have been included in the stock SmartDashboard, honestly.

### installation

Copy the SmartDashboard-USBRotate.jar to ```%USERPROFILE%\SmartDashboard\extensions.```

If the extensions folder doesn't exists, create it. 

When you start SmartDashboard, you should see a new widget available in the Add menu.

### credit where it's due
wpilib developers for managing to make all this SmartDashboard code that has been pasted into this project.

If I was able to find a license, I would have included it.

### warning: this code is not guarenteed to work
